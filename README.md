This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Make sure to install the neccesary npm packages using `npm install`.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Building and running the app.

The NextJS config file is already set up to build a static export, so you can just run `npm run build`, the final product will be put into the `out` directory.

To synchronise the built static web app and the native apps, run `npx cap sync`.

To synchronise the capacitor project settings, run `npx cap copy`.

To run the Android or iOS projects, run `npx cap open android` or `npx cap open ios` respectively.
